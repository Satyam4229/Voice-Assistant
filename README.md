# Virtual-Assistant
The main idea behind this virtual assistant is google assistant. I see that this is something awesome so, i have to create one for me. I have some experience in python and with their libraries. Then i started creating this project just for my fun.

In this project, i have mainly three kind of libraries which are speech recognition, voice engine powered by google, Libraries for operating system. With all this stuff, I created my own voice assistant which is very simple and at the same time it's crazy too.

## What can it do :-
1. Greet you according to the time
2. Search things for you from the different search engine.
3. Chat with you
4. Send emails just by saying it
5. read text and story for you
6. open different folder and software for you
